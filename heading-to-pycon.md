Today I'm flying out to Santa Clara for [PyCon][]! This will be my first one
and I'm really excited!

# Tutorials

On Wednesday I'm taking a couple of data oriented tutorials:
[Introduction to Pydata][pydata] and  [Bayesian statistics made simple][bayes].
I already know quite a bit on those topics but I'm looking forward to learning
more about [pandas][] and  [PyTables][], and it can't hurt to brush up on
my statistics.

# Education Summit

On Thursday I'm taking part in the first ever
[Python Education Summit][edu summit]. There should be a lot to learn about
teaching with Python and I'm curious to see what is done in venues other than
[Software Carpentry][].

# Talks

I haven't yet decided on all of the talks I want to see but
[Daniel Greenfield's][pydanny] [PyCon guide][] has given me some good ideas.
My own talk on [Teaching with the IPython Notebook][my talk] is on Saturday
at 1:55 PM. The talks immediately after mine look interesting; the first is on
[building scientific applications with Python][scipy apps] and the second
is about [Numba][numba talk], a tool for
[speeding up numeric calculations][numba].

# Job Fair

There are a ton of companies signed up for the [PyCon Job Fair][], I'll
definitely be there with my [resume][]!

# Say Hi!

I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of people at PyCon! If you would
like to meet up at the conference drop me a line on [App.net][], [twitter][],
[Google+][], or by [email][]. See you there!
