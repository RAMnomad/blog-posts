As folks become more aware of the social justice challenges we face as a
country and in our communities they often wonder how they can help.
There's not one really great answer because we all have different experience
levels, means, axes of privilege, and available free time, but there are some
common-sense "getting started" points. People with privilege who help social
just causes are often called allies (but more on this word below), and this
post is about how allies can learn how to help. A very short and incomplete
TL;DR:

- don't center your own ego and feelings at the expense of others'
- examine and change your own behavior so you don't perpetuate bad habits
- whole-heartedly listen to people with less privilege than you
- educate yourself on the history and literature of the movements you are interested in
- step up when you can

The following are several resources for people looking for specific things to
think about and act on. This list is focused on diversity-in-tech, and
especially gender diversity, so pointers to other resources would be great.

  This talk and the accompanying slide deck are great introduction to why social
  justice movements need active allies and how those allies can help.
- Ally Skills Workshop: https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/workshops-and-training/
  This video and accompanying materials give lots of specific things allies can
  do to spot bad behavior and how to respond to it.

(A note about the word "ally": there's a real failing of language here because
we use this noun to refer to privileged supporters of social justice causes,
but the causes don't need nouns, they need actions. You can't do 10 supportive
things and then have the label "ally" for life. It's a process of doing what
you can, when you can. This essay gives a great breakdown of the distinction:
