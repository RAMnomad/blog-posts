I've got a [blog post][] up over on the [Software Carpentry][] blog about trying
out [ipythonblocks][] in the classroom for the first time. Summary: it was a
hit! The students really got a lot out of being able to immediately see the
result of their code. We also did a lot of "what do you think this will do?",
which I think helped get the students thinking a bit more computationally.
Some of the more advanced students even struck off on their own making their
own designs instead of just sitting there bored.

I'm really looking forward to using ipythonblocks again at my next boot camps
in May, and I hope others get some use out of it in the meantime!
