The [SciPy 2013][] conference is coming up on June 24-29 in Austin, Texas
and you should go. Here are some good reasons:

**You'll learn something.** There are beginning, intermediate, and advanced
[tutorial tracks][tutorials] this year, so it would be pretty much impossible
for you not to learn something at those. I'll even be there with [Katy Huff][]
teaching a tutorial on [version control and testing][swc-tutorial]. Even if you
can't make it to the tutorials there will lots of great talks and BOF sessions.

**There are domain specific mini-symposia.** If your field is represented you
can go for a concentrated dose of relevant talks and to meet other Python users
in your field. Here are the specific domains this year:

* Astronomy & astrophysics
* Bio-informatics
* GIS - Geospatial Data Analysis
* Medical imaging
* Meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric and oceanic science

**It'll be fun!** The scientific Python community is chock full of really nice
people. Even if you're new and just learning how to use Python you'll meet
people who are eager to talk and make you feel welcome. (If you find this is
not the case, [email me][] or [tweet me][] and I will see if I can help.)
