The [SciPy 2013][] conference is coming up on June 24-29 in Austin, Texas
and you should go. Here are some good reasons:

**You'll learn something.** There are beginning, intermediate, and advanced
[tutorial tracks][tutorials] this year, so it would be pretty much impossible
for you not to learn something at those. I'll even be there with [Katy Huff][]
teaching a tutorial on [version control and testing][swc-tutorial]. Even if you
can't make it to the tutorials there will lots of great talks and BOF sessions.

**There are domain specific mini-symposia.** If your field is represented you
can go for a concentrated dose of relevant talks and to meet other Python users
in your field. Here are the specific domains this year:

* Astronomy & astrophysics
* Bio-informatics
* GIS - Geospatial Data Analysis
* Medical imaging
* Meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric and oceanic science

**It'll be fun!** The scientific Python community is chock full of really nice
people. Even if you're new and just learning how to use Python you'll meet
people who are eager to talk and make you feel welcome. (If you find this is
not the case, [email me][] or [tweet me][] and I will see if I can help.)

# Diversity at SciPy

I've been going to SciPy since 2010 and every year the attendees and speakers
have been disappointingly white and male. Last year [Andy Terrel][andy] and
[I][scipy2012] chided the conference organizers about this and it looks like
this year the organizers (which include Andy) are actually trying to do
something about diversity: there is a [Diversity Statement][diversity],
a [Code of Conduct][conduct], and [pyladies][] will be there as a community
sponsor.

If you're not sure about SciPy because you're worried you won't fit in or won't
be welcome I want to be the first to tell you that you don't need to worry and
that you should come. Everyone who comes to SciPy has agreed to abide by the
[Code of Conduct][conduct] and the conference organizers are there to help if
you experience any problems. SciPy is a conference for everyone and having a
more diverse community is good for all of us.
