In the interest of helping to improve the diversity and beginner friendliness
of the [SciPy conference][SciPy 2015],
I'm offering to help first-time speakers from underrepresented groups
with their talk proposals and potential talk preparations for [SciPy 2015][].
If that sounds like you and you'd like my help editing a proposal
and/or preparing a talk, [send me an email](mailto:jiffyclub@gmail.com).

Notes:

- The deadline for proposals is April 1
- The conference is July 8-10 in Austin, Texas
- SciPy has a [Code of Conduct][conduct]
- SciPy is [committed to diversity][diversity]
- SciPy has some [financial aid][]
- I will be at the conference
- I'm not a conference organizer, but I have in the past helped with talk
    selection (and may again this year)
- I have never given a talk at SciPy (except lightning talks)
