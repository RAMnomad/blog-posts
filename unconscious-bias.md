[This post][programmer-moneyball] came across my Twitter feed this week that
talks about some of the spurious, meaningless reasons software engineering
candidates are rejected. It's challenging to evaluate candidates and we have a
lot of productive discussions about how best to do that, but there some
personal characteristics that we know are irrelevant to job performance:
gender, race, age, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, accent,
where you grew up, etc. But even though we know those characteristics are
irrelevant, they can still unconsciously affect how we evaluate and work with
people through something called unconscious bias.

Unconscious bias manifests in some scary and surprising ways. For example,
[elementary school teachers give girls lower scores on math tests][school],
unless they don't know the gender of the students.

Another [study][pnas] examined gender bias in academic science. From the
abstract: "In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from
research- intensive universities rated the application materials of a
student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory
manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as
significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female
applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and
offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty
participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were
equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student."

Bias can even have far reaching, unintended affects. Early marketing of
personal computers targeted almost exclusively boys and that probably
[had an affect on the number of women seeking computer science degrees today][coding].

One of the ways to combat unconscious bias is to learn more about it, which you
can do with these resources:

to educate coworkers on diversity and inclusion topics.*
