The [SciPy 2015][] [call for proposals][] is open until April 1.
In case anyone wants to give a talk but doesn't have an idea I
came up with a few:

- introduction to testing with a focus on numerics
- guide to profiling
- introduction to packaging and distribution
- scidb
- xray
- bcolz
- which tool to use for which job (cover core packages)
- data visualization options
- write a numpy ufunc in Python, Cython, and C
- roundup of high-performance options (C, Cython, Numba, Parakeet, etc.)

Thanks to [Rob Story][] for some suggestions.
If you've got ideas for talks you'd like to see, leave a comment!

(I will be at SciPy 2015, but I'm organizing a [Software Carpentry][]
tutorial so I probably won't be submitting a talk proposal.)
