Dismissive language harks back to my [post about microaggressions][agro]. It's
very easy to accidentally say something dismissive without realizing it. The
most common examples of dismissive language I encounter are in descriptions of
complex topics, often with the words "just" and "should". For example, "All you
need to do is just git rebase and everything should be fine" or "Just change
this setting in your config and it should just work". These constructions
trivialize the listener's problem and imply that they are stupid for not being
able to figure it out on their own. (I've given technical examples here, but I
imagine that this can happen in any context with complexity, like knitting or
wet labs.)

I think it's a good practice to try to completely remove the word "just" from
your vocabulary, and watch your usage of the word "should" as well. At a
fundamental level this is about putting yourself in someone else's shoes,
thinking about whether what you're saying is appropriate given their level of
experience, and making sure you're not going to make them feel dumb by making
something that's actually hard/complex sound like you expect it to be obvious.

This is something we worry about a lot in [Software Carpentry][swc] because
we're teaching complex computing topics to novice programmers. In fact, we
recommend instructors completely avoid the word "just". We discuss this a
little in our instructor training materials:

Software Carpentry's [founder][gvwilson] recently put together a short, 2.5
minute video giving examples of many of things you should not do when
explaining complex topics to novices, such as using jargon and trivializing
complexity. It's worth a cringe-inducing watch:

The Recurse Center's social rules also provide some great examples of things
not to do: https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules

[work][] to educate coworkers on diversity and inclusion topics.*
