Yesterday I asked my followers on Twitter for their advice on the best
resources for people learning programming and Python:

https://twitter.com/jiffyclub/status/456186462359552001

You can see their responses [on Twitter][responses] and below.

- [olgabot][]: [Code Academy][]
- [modernscientist][]: [Learn Python the Hard Way][]
- [AlexVianaPro][]: [Think Python][]
- [oceankidbilly][]: A list of resources [posted on reddit][reddit]
- [ptone][]: [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist][]
- [pani5ue][]: [Google's Python Class][]

Of those, I think [Think Python][] and 
[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist][] are especially targetted at
people who are brand new to programming in any language.

These are some of the resources
I learned from back when I picked up Python, though I should note that
I already knew some programming at the time:

- [Learning Python][]
- [Programming Python][]
- [Official Python Docs][]

Thanks to everyone who responded!
