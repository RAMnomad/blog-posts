[Microaggressions][geek-fem] are small, often unintentional actions that can
make others feel out of place. Examples can include asking where someone is
from, acting surprised when someone doesn't know something, or always
expecting women to do office-keeping work. They can make people
feel like they don't belong and distract them from doing their actual jobs.
"Micro"-aggressions might not sound so bad, but over time and many
interactions they create an unwelcoming environment that can cause employees
to leave or cause people to not want to attend events. As an example, a
friend of mine almost [swore off of all tech events][lonely] after she went to
a social event where everyone ignored her and talked to her lawyer
husband instead.

It's everyone's job to make sure they're actively creating a environment in
which everyone feels that they fully belong. You can help by learning more
about microaggressions and doing your best to avoid committing them (they hurt
even when you don't mean them to).

Here are a couple of good links that describe what migroaggressions are and the
affect they have:
