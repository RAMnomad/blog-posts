This year at [SciPy 2015][] I'd like to run some informal "office hours"
help sessions to help people with any questions they might have.
I can imagine questions about:

- scientific Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib...)
- software installation (Anaconda, conda, pip...)
- software packaging
- Git & GitHub
- the command line (shell)
- web applications
- much more!

I'll do the first session on Wednesday, July 8 from 1 to 2 PM
(this is during the first BoF session).
I'm not sure exactly where we'll do this, but probably one of the
conference center lobby areas.
[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jiffyclub) for updates
about the exact location.

If there seems to be significant interest I'll try to find times
for some additional sessions, but that might be hard to do.

Whether you've got questions or answers, I hope you'll join!
