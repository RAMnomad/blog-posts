of the conference center.*

This year at [SciPy 2015][] I'd like to run some informal "office hours"
help sessions to help people with any questions they might have.
I can imagine questions about:

- scientific Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib...)
- software installation (Anaconda, conda, pip...)
- software packaging
- Git & GitHub
- the command line (shell)
- web applications
- much more!

The sessions will be during the afternoon coffee breaks 3 - 3:30 PM each
day of the conference (Wednesday - Friday).
The SciPy organizers have very kindly reserved room 210 for the sessions.
[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jiffyclub) for any
last minute updates.

If there seems to be significant interest I'll try to find times
for some additional sessions, but that might be hard to do.

Whether you've got questions or answers, I hope you'll join!
